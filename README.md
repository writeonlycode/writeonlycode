# Hi, Iâ€™m Iago Bozza

I am a software engineer with three years of experience in both back-end and front-end development. Throughout my career, I have developed a strong expertise in Next.JS, Hugo SSG and Supabase.

In addition to my technical skills, I hold a Ph.D. in philosophy, which has honed my problem-solving and critical thinking abilities. I bring a unique perspective to software development, enabling me to approach challenges creatively and find innovative solutions.

Currently, I work as a freelancer full-stack developer, collaborating with clients from diverse industries to deliver high-quality software solutions. I am now open for a permanent role where I can apply my technical expertise and passion for software development to make a meaningful contribution to a team. If you are looking for a dedicated and experienced software engineer who can drive results, I would love to connect.
