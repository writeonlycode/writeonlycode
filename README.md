# Hi, Iâ€™m Iago Bozza

I am a software engineer with experience in both back-end and front-end
development. I have expertise in Ruby on Rails, Node and Hugo, as well as
experience with a range of other technologies. With a background in philosophy,
I bring a unique perspective to software development and excel at
problem-solving and critical thinking.

I am currently seeking a back-end developer role where I can apply my technical
skills and passion for software development to make a meaningful contribution
to a team.
